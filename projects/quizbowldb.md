**Description:** [QuizbowlDB](http://www.quizbowldb.com) has been an ongoing project for me since high school. It is a search engine for around 33000 quizbowl questions that allows filtering questions by category and other criteria. The categories of the questions were determined by a 1-nn classifier which uses a custom question distance function as a feature. It also reads questions word by word as a study tool. Its current iteration's backend stores the questions in MySQL, with a Sphinx search index. Questions are stored in memcached for quicker retrieval. The front end is written in backbone.js and communicates with a REST API served up by a node.js web server. It gets around 800 hits per day from quizbowlers around the nation.

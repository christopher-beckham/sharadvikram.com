**Description:** I found making this website a lot of fun for a few reasons:

1. I learnt [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) in the process and found it a really awesome framework.
2. I wanted to make it really easy to write content, so there's some interesting client-side markdown parsing happening. Basically, I can write project descriptions or blog posts using standard markdown syntax, but also embed LaTeX for equations and more complicated things.
3. I suck at design and wanted to actually try to design a website that doesn't look terrible.

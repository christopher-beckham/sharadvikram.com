**Description** : This hack combined arduinos, aluminum foil, and some machine learning to create a capacity-sensitive paper cube that recognized gestures. Tapping a side of the cube would perform some action, such as playing/pausing music, or opening Chrome. The capacitive sensors were would also recognize hovering, so we could wave our hand over the cube and perform more complex actions, such as making our browser do a barrel roll.

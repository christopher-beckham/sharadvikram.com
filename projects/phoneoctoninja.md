**Description:** Phone Octo Ninja is a way to control devices using the smart phone camera. The idea is that we can point our camera at some device, tap on the phone screen, and perform some action on the device. An example would be to point our camera at a light, and tap on the light to turn it off. We accomplished this by attaching a green tag to every device we wanted to control and used some basic computer vision on the phone to find these devices. We then used 3D geometry to infer what devices we were pointing at on the phone camera based on accelerometer and compass data. Finally, we sent a command to the device over radio. We extended this to be able to perform generic gestures on the phone to effect more complex actions on other devices. For example, pointing at speakers and swiping to the right would play the next song.
